## 1. Introduction

The aim of this project is to investigate the statistical properties of Wifi systems operating indoors. We shall do this by using a set of orthogonal basis functions called *Laguerre functions* to construct a mathematical model of the probability density function describing the attenuation caused by the scattering process in the wireless communication medium. 

The project starts by showing how orthogonality is a useful property and that Laguerre functions are orthogonal before moving on to **unfinished**

## 2. Orthogonality

We can use orthogonal basis functions to model our data. Orthogonal basis functions, such as:

$$ {f(0) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 }$$ 

are useful because we can add more $$$x$$$ terms without having to recalculate our previous coefficients. 

### 2.3 Fourier Series

A common orthogonal basis set Fourier series, the functions $$$cos(n \\omega x)$$$ and $$$sin(n \\omega x)$$$, for  $$$n = 0, 1, ... $$$  formed an orthogonal set when the inner product is defined by the integral over a period $$$T = 2\\pi \\over \\omega$$$, divided by the period.

### 2.4 Using Matlab to compute Fourier series

#### 2.4.2 Reminder about Matlab functions

We are given a function `fs-orthog.m` which integrates Fourier basis functions over a period. We are asked to write some code, `fs_orthogtest.m`, which calls this function for $$$cos(m x) \\times cos(n x)$$$ for $$$ m = 0 \\to 6 $$$ and $$$ n = 0 \\to 6$$$ and stores the result in a 2D matrix:

```
coscos = zeros(7); %set up a 7x7 matrix of zeroes to store the integral results

for m = 0 : 6
    for n = 0 : 6
        coscos(m+1, n+1) = fs_orthog(1, 1000, m, n, 'cc'); 
    end
end
```
We later repeat this code to include $$$sin(m x) \\times sin(n x)$$$ and $$$cos(m x) \\times sin(n x)$$$

**What is the reason for this failure?**

#### 2.4.3 Code to compute Fourier series coefficients

To compute the Fourier series coefficients, we are given two pieces of code, `fs_Acoeff.m` and `fs_Bcoeff.m` which calculate the $$$ A_m $$$ and $$$ B_m $$$ coefficients respectively. These functions are called from a top level script, `fs_triangle.m` to plot a graph of the Fourier series approximation of a periodic function. The periodic function, a triangle wave:

**insert function**

is generated by `fs_periodictriangle.m`.

If we run `fs_triangle.m` with four $$$n$$$ terms, we obtain the plot:

- **Vary nterms to assess at what point the reproduction is decent.**

- Create a new Matlab function(s) to generate the periodic function shown in Fig. 2.4, where a is a parameter. Explore the number of terms required to provide a decent representation of the function as a gets smaller.

I created a new function `

## 3. Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalisation

1. explain the mathematics behind your method,
2. describe your implementation and supply the key parts of the code,
3. write clearly how to run your code,
4. describe the computational experiments you designed and performed to verify its performance,
5. give results, and importantly,
6. draw conclusions.


## 4. Laguerre
