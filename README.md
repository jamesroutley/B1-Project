## Wireless Communication Channels: Characterisation Using Orthogonal Functions

A third year Engineering computation project using MATLAB. The project writeup is stored in B1writeup.pdf, and the code is stored in the Matlab folder.

The aim of this project is to investigate the statistical properties of Wifi systems operating indoors. We shall do this by using a set of orthogonal basis functions called *Laguerre functions* to construct a mathematical model of the probability density function describing the attenuation caused by the scattering process in the wireless communication medium. 

The project starts by showing how orthogonality is a useful property. We go on to investigate Gram-Schmitt Orthogonalisation before generating and using Laguerre functions to model the wifi data given to us.
